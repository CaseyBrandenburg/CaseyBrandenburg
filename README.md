### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Casey Brandenburg, and I am a 23 year old computer science student studying at the University of Kentucky.

My passion is front-end UI/UX development, particulary for mobile applications.

I am currently solo-developing a Christian fitness, nutrition, and life improvement IOS application called Crowns.
This has been an incredible experience learning the ins and outs of the Swift programming language, SwiftUI, and the full-stack
application development process. It has also been excellent practice for designing intuitive user interfaces, and tuning
them based on feedback from my pool of beta testers.

In addition to this, I hope to soon start learning React, and becoming more familiar with that workflow.
