### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Casey Brandenburg, and I am a 23 year old computer science student studying at the University of Kentucky.

Right now I am learning the swift programming language and using it to learn the process of ios app development.

I am currently developing a Christian fitness and life improvement application called Crowns. Stay tuned for updates!
