### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Casey Brandenburg, and I am a 22 year old computer science student studying at the University of Kentucky.

Right now I am learning the swift programming language and using it to learn the process of app development.

In my free time I am currently using Unreal Engine 5 along with several other softwares to learn the game development process and hopefully produce my first product.
